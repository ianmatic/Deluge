# DELUGE
Deluge is a single-player tile based strategically minded action rpg. The game is currently in development by a team of four people ranging from artists to writers to programmers, most of them spanning multiple roles. 

## How can I get an active build of this game?
Reach out to Justin (email listed below) and he'll get you a current version of the game. This repo isn't very human readible thanks to how Unity keeps track of their files in-engine. That means this repo is primarily for the devs to be able to pass their work back and forth. If you have interest in learning more about the game, again reach out to Justin and he'll connect you with any information that you need.

## Can I help make this game?
At the moment, our team is close to all but 3D artists, technical artists (rigging/skinning), or texture painters. If you're one of those things, send some of your work to the contact below. Otherwise, we appreciate the interest but are trying to stick to a skeleton squad for a more agile team environment.

This repository holds the current version of our game in development. If you're interested in fun things like our design docs or architecture docs, reach out to me (jtv6445@g.rit.edu) and I can get those for you.
